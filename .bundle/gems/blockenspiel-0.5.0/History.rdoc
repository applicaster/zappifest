=== 0.5.0 / 2016-01-07

* Fixed an issue with the proxy strategy, where if a block spawns blocks that live longer than it, the sub-blocks lost their context.
* Changed the default strategy to proxy due to semantic issues with mixin and difficulty supporting it.
* Dropped support for the mixin strategy on MRI because Ruby 2.3.0 broke it and I don't have the bandwidth to find a remedy.
* Updated the Rakefile, tests, and general infrastructure to play better with modern Rubies.
* Dropped support for Ruby 1.8, because who still uses 1.8???

=== 0.4.6 / (never actually released)

* Compatibility with the signature change to reset_method_cache in recent builds of Rubinius 2.0.
* The gemspec no longer includes the timestamp in the version, so that bundler can pull from github. (Reported by corneverbruggen)
* The Rakefile is now compatible with Ruby 2.0 and RubyGems 2.0.

=== 0.4.5 / 2012-06-27

* The 0.4.4 build was missing the JRuby unmixer. Fixed.

=== 0.4.4 / 2012-06-27

* Under JRuby 1.9 mode, if two threads mixed into the same object, the calls sometimes went to the wrong place. Fixed.
* The VERSION constant behaved very oddly under Rubinius 1.9 mode. Fixed.
* Eliminate some warnings.
* Integrate with Travis CI.

=== 0.4.3 / 2011-06-22

* MRI C extension experienced a compile error under the current MRI head (e.g. 1.9.3). Fixed.
* Rake-based build of the MRI C extension failed under newer rakes. Fixed.
* Eliminated some Rakefile deprecation warnings under newer rakes.

=== 0.4.2 / 2011-06-02

* Fixed an unmixer compatibility issue with Rubinius > 1.2.x. (Thanks to @meh for the fix.)
* Recent versions of Rubinius raised exceptions involving Fiber. Fixed.
* Workaround for a JRuby NullPointerException (JRUBY-5842).
* Integrated JRuby platform gem back into main gem.
* A .gemspec file is now available for gem building and bundler git integration.
* Some cleanup of the Rakefile and tests.

=== 0.4.1 / 2010-06-23

* Support for rubinius 1.0.

=== 0.4.0 / 2010-06-21

* Implemented string- and file-based DSLs (in addition to block-based).
* Correctly handle separate active DSLs in different fibers within the
  same thread, when fibers are avaialble.
* Updated ruby runtime dependencies to reflect what I'm actually testing.
* Organized the source a little better, and fixed some Rakefile quirks.

=== 0.3.3 / 2010-05-24

* Some Rakefile fixes to match RDoc and Ruby 1.9 changes.
* Minor documentation updates.

=== 0.3.2 / 2009-11-17

* Modules included in a DSL-ized class now have their methods included in
  the DSL.
* Raise a more informative error (for now) when trying to include
  Blockenspiel::DSL in a module. At some point, we'll support this usage,
  once I figure out the right semantics for it.

=== 0.3.1 / 2009-11-08

* Blockenspiel#invoke can now take its options hash as the second argument
  (instead of the third) when using dynamic target generation, since the
  second argument is otherwise unused in this case.
* Now defines Blockenspiel::VERSION, as a versionomy object if the
  versionomy library is available, or as a version string if not.

=== 0.3.0 / 2009-11-04

* dsl_attr_writer and dsl_attr_accessor convenience methods are available
  for creating DSL-friendly attributes.
* Dynamic DSL methods can now take real block arguments, if supported by
  the Ruby interpreter.
* Shortened README.rdoc and renamed the longer version to Blockenspiel.rdoc.
* Some documentation updates.

=== 0.2.2 / 2009-10-28

* Support for gemcutter hosting in the build/release scripts.
* Some clarifications to constant scopes internal in the code.
* A few documentation updates.
* Minor changes to the Implementing DSL Blocks paper to deal with
  Why's disappearance.

=== 0.2.1 / 2009-04-16

* Now compatible with Ruby 1.9.
* Now compatible with JRuby 1.2.
* No longer requires the mixology gem.
* Building no longer requires hoe.

=== 0.2.0 / 2009-04-15

* Earlier build of 0.2.1 that had some problems with JRuby.

=== 0.1.1 / 2008-11-06

* Added ability to pass the block as the first parameter in
  the dynamic DSL builder API; cleaned up the API a little
* Minor fixes to Implementing DSL Blocks paper
* Some updates to rdocs
* More test coverage

=== 0.1.0 / 2008-10-29

* Documentation revisions
* Revisions to the Implementing DSL Blocks paper

=== 0.0.3 / 2008-10-23

* Added :proxy behavior for parameterless blocks
* Removed option to turn off inheriting, since the semantics are somewhat
  ill-defined and inconsistent. All parameterless blocks now exhibit the
  inheriting behavior.
* Added tests for the different behavior settings.
